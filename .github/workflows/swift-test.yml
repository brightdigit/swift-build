  # Matrix Strategy Note:
  # - macOS tests use explicit include entries due to complex platform configurations
  #   (SPM, macos, ios, watchos, tvos, visionos) with varying parameters
  # - Ubuntu and Windows tests use matrix dimensions for their uniform configurations
  # This intentional difference optimizes readability and maintainability for each platform
