### Example Configurations

#### Basic Usage
```yaml
- uses: org/swift-build@v1
  with:
    scheme: MyPackage
```

#### Multi-Platform Matrix
```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    include:
      - os: ubuntu-latest
        swift: "6.0"
      - os: macos-latest
        type: ios
        deviceName: "iPhone 15"
        osVersion: "17.5"
```

#### Advanced Configuration
```yaml
- uses: org/swift-build@v1
  with:
    working-directory: packages/core
    scheme: CorePackage
    type: visionos
    xcode: "/Applications/Xcode_16_beta.app"
    deviceName: "Apple Vision Pro"
    osVersion: "2.0"
    download-platform: true
```

**Note**: For Swift Packages in Xcode, the scheme may automatically include a "-Package" suffix when there's only one product with the same name as the package itself (e.g., "MyLibrary" package might have a "MyLibrary-Package" scheme).
